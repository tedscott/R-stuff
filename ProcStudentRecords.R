# some quick stats stuff

########################

# based on the plots, it appears that there is a difference in the scores given out by each
# teacher for each class

# let's test whether or not the apparent difference in scores between the teachers is statistically
# significant such that we might want to go discuss with the teachers/students to find out if
# there might be something going on to explain the difference


# check for equal variances in the scores by teacher to see if we can trust the p-value of a t-test
var.test(newRecords$score[newRecords$teacher=="mein"], newRecords$score[newRecords$teacher=="scott"])

# p-value is greater than 0.05 (5% significance is common)
# which means the variances are not statisticaly different and hence are homogeneous enough for a t-test


# we could assign the scores to variables to save typing like so
# mein <- newRecords$score[newRecords$teacher=="mein"]
# scott <- newRecords$score[newRecords$teacher=="scott"]
# but I won't to be explicit and make each line clearer

# since variance is similar between the two sets of scores, let's check...
# is there a statistically significant difference in student scores between the teachers?
t.test(newRecords$score[newRecords$teacher=="mein"], newRecords$score[newRecords$teacher=="scott"], var.equal=TRUE)

# p-value is 0.066, which is not significant at the p = 0.05 level but pretty close
# so there is a nearly significant difference in the scores of the students between the
# two teachers

# you could argue that the two sets of students are NOT independent given that they all attend EPS
# and have other classes in common, so you could add "paired=TRUE" to the t-test
t.test(newRecords$score[newRecords$teacher=="mein"], newRecords$score[newRecords$teacher=="scott"], var.equal=TRUE, paired=TRUE)

# now you get a p-value of 0.054, so there may be something to say here about the scores being different between the two teachers
# you could do a one sided t-test where the null hypothesis is that the mean score is nearly the same 
# and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean scores for teacher "mein" are statistically lower
# but in this toy data set the answer will be that we reject the null in favor of the alternate hypothesis :)

# there's so much more that could be done with this simple dataset, but hopefully this gives you an idea
# of some of the ease and power of R for analysis
